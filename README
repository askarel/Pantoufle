If you ever tried to shoehorn a bunch of operating systems for the netboot
setup of your hackerspace, you know how painful it can be when distributions
installation images expect to be alone on the server, and the pain come back
when you want to update it.

This is an attempt at building a package manager for your netboot setup.
It will automatically download the latest images and build a nice menu 

The code expect very little dependencies: it requires an internet connection
to download the images and tools that are installed by default on any linux 
system or available as busybox applets (tar, gzip, wget,...)

The code is a bunch of shell scripts and should be running on any OpenWRT box
without extensive modifications.
